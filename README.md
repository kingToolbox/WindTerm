# Terminal Performance

The hardware used for generating the data in these benchmarks was

    windows 10 - 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB memory.
    MacOs 10.13 - 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB memory.

**WindTerm 1.72, rxvt, putty, xterm, Windows Terminal** tests are performed on WSL(Ubuntu 18.04.2). 

**Iterm2, kitty, Alacritty** tests are performed on MacOS shell, 

    For WindTerm: No color scheme used in windterm. Color scheme will result in approximately 2% loss and more memory usage.

    For Alacritty: Only supports up to 100,000 scrollback lines, so every test use "history: 100000" setting and no memory usage measured.

    For Windows Terminal: Only supports up to 65,535 scrollback lines, so every test use "historySize: 65535" setting and no memory usage measured.

# Linux Terminal Performance

The hardware used for generating the data in these benchmarks was

    Debian 10 Vm - 4cpu and 4GB memory.

    For WindTerm: No color scheme used in windterm. Color scheme will result in approximately 2% loss and more memory usage.

    For other terminals: No memory usage measured because most of them write the history to disk or only support a limited number of lines in memory..

| --- | --- | --- |
| Windterm | v1.9 | 2020-12-22 |
