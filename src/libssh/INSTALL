# How to build from source

## Requirements

### Common requirements

In order to build libssh, you need to install several components:

- A C compiler
- [CMake](https://www.cmake.org) >= 2.6.0.
- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org) >= 0.9.8
or
- [gcrypt](https://www.gnu.org/directory/Security/libgcrypt.html) >= 1.4
- [libz](https://www.zlib.net) >= 1.2

optional:
- [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) >= 1.1.0
- [socket_wrapper](https://cwrap.org/) >= 1.1.5
- [nss_wrapper](https://cwrap.org/) >= 1.1.2
- [uid_wrapper](https://cwrap.org/) >= 1.2.0
- [pam_wrapper](https://cwrap.org/) >= 1.0.1

Note that these version numbers are version we know works correctly. If you
build and run libssh successfully with an older version, please let us know.

For Windows use vcpkg:

https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg

which you can use to install openssl and zlib. libssh itself is also part of
vcpkg!

## Building
First, you need to configure the compilation, using CMake. Go inside the
`build` dir. Create it if it doesn't exist.

GNU/Linux, MacOS X, MSYS/MinGW:

    cmake -DUNIT_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    make

On Windows you should choose a makefile gernerator with -G or use

    cmake-gui.exe ..

To enable additional client tests against a local OpenSSH server, add the
compile option -DCLIENT_TESTING=ON. These tests require an OpenSSH
server package and some wrapper libraries (see optional requirements) to
be installed.

If you're interested in server testing, then a OpenSSH client should be
installed on the system and if possible also dropbear. Once that is done
enable server support with -DWITH_SERVER=ON and enable testing of it with
-DSERVER_TESTING=ON.

## Testing build

    make test

### CMake standard options
Here is a list of the most interesting options provided out of the box by
CMake.

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:     The type of build (can be Debug Release MinSizeRel
                        RelWithDebInfo)
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: The prefix to use when running make install (Default
                        to /usr/local on GNU/Linux and MacOS X)
- CMAKE_C_COMPILER:     The path to the C compiler
- CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:   The path to the C++ compiler

### CMake options defined for libssh

Options are defined in the following files:

- DefineOptions.cmake

They can be changed with the -D option:

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_ZLIB=OFF ..`

### Browsing/editing CMake options

In addition to passing options on the command line, you can browse and edit
CMake options using `cmakesetup` (Windows), `cmake-gui` or `ccmake` (GNU/Linux
and MacOS X).

- Go to the build dir
- On Windows: run `cmakesetup`
- On GNU/Linux and MacOS X: run `ccmake ..`

### Useful Windows options:

If you have installed OpenSSL or ZLIB in non standard directories, maybe you
want to set:

OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR

and

ZLIB_ROOT_DIR

## Installing

If you want to install libssh after compilation run:

    make install

## Running

The libssh binary can be found in the `build/src` directory.
You can use `build/examples/samplessh` which is a sample client to
test libssh on UNIX.
